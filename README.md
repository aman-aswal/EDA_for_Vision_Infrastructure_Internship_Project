# EDA_for_Vision_Infrastructure_Internship_Project
This project was completed as part of my Summer Internship with Vision Infrastructure, a company offering specialized real estate education. The goal was to analyze course sales data from the Indian market and uncover insights that can improve marketing strategies, optimize course offerings, and enhance learner engagement.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The project involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify sales trends, top-performing courses, seasonal variations, and marketing effectiveness. An interactive dashboard (consisting graph and charts) was created to present these findings visually for better decision-making.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ Data cleaning and analysis
Excel â€“ Preprocessing and initial exploration
Jupyter Notebook â€“ Reproducible EDA workflows

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Top courses contributed over 60% of total revenue.
Seasonal spikes observed during pre-exam months and festive offers.
Social media marketing generated the highest enrollments, while email campaigns had lower conversions.
Certain courses had high refund rates, indicating the need for quality or content improvements.

ðŸš€ Features
Clean, well-documented Python scripts for data analysis.
Interactive dashboard with filters for course, date, and marketing channel.
Data-driven recommendations for increasing sales and improving marketing ROI.
